# Scalability

Defined as: *a measure of the number of users an application can effectively support at the same time.*

Application logic runs on *compute nodes* and data is stored on *data nodes*

In the cloud a compute node is likely a vm. A data node is likely a cluster of servers.

#### Vertically scaling up:

- Increase overall application capacity by increasing the resources within existing nodes.

#### Horizontally scaling out:

- Increase the overall application capacity by adding nodes.
